# Life Cyclones

This is a React app for the front end of the Life Cyclones Online Computer Store (csc 322).

### Setup Development Environment

1. If you don't have it, install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
1. If you don't have a [github](https://github.com/) account, create one.
1. Get the life-cyclones repository.
   1. Open a terminal and navigate to where you want to download.
   1. `git clone https://github.com/neil-solomon/life-cyclones.git` to clone the repository.
1. `cd life-cyclones` to navigate into the repository folder.
1. `npm install` to install dependencies (this may take a few minutes).
1. `npm start` to run the React development server. This will open `http://localhost:3000/` in your default browser.
1. View `React_README.md` to see the README that comes with create-react-app.

### Working with Github

1. Before making changes to the code make sure to pull updates, and then work on a branch other than `main`.
   1. `git pull` to pull updates from Github.
   1. `git branch <branchName>` to create a new branch.
   1. `git checkout <branchName>` to switch to a branch.
1. Save repo after making code changes.
   1. `git add .` to stage all files for commit.
   1. `git commit -m "<message>"` to commit changes to your local repository.
   1. `git push origin <branchName>` to push committed changes to Github.
   1. Github may now ask you to login. If the push fails after login, make sure you accepted the invation to collaborate.
1. The branch that you're working on will later be merged with the `main` branch.
